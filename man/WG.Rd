\description{
Weather generators for conditional simulation of daily temperature and/or
precipitation, given mean and/or standard deviation. The family of WG
functions produce stochastic time series with similar characteristics as the
station series provided (if none if provided, it will use either ferder or
bjornholt provided by the esd-package). Here characteristics means similar
mean value, standard deviation, (frequency and wet-day mean precipitation for 
precipitation), and spectral properties. \code{FTscramble}
takes the Fourier components (doing a Fourier Transform - FT) of a series 
and reassigns random phase to each frequency and then returns a new series 
through an inverse FT. The FT scrambling is used for temperature, but not for 
daily precipitation that is non-Gaussian and involves sporadic events with rain. 
Instead, \code{FTscramble} is used for randomly scrambling annual wet-day frequency 
and wet-day mean precipitation, however, and for precipitation, the annual wet-day
frequency and the annual wet-day mean precipitation are used to randomly generate
exponentially distributed numbers to provide similar aggregated annual
statistics as the station or predicted though downscaling. The precipitation
WG can also take into account the number of consecutive number-of-wet-days
statistics using a geometric distribution.

\details{
The weather generator produces a series with similar length as the provided
sample data, but with shifted dates according to specified scenarios for
annual mean mean/standard deviation/wet-day mean/wet-day frequency.

\code{WG.FT.day.t2m} generates daily temperature from seasonal means and
standard deviations. It is given a sample station series, and uses
\code{FTscramble} is based on a Fourier Transform which generates a new series 
with random phase but nevertheless similar (or predicted - in the future) spectral 
characteristics as the original series. It then uses a quantile
transform to prescribe predicted mean and standard deviation, assuming the
distributions are normal, which usually is OK for seasonall/annually aggregated statistics 
(e.g. annual mean, annual wet-day frequency, or annual wet-day mean precipitation). 
The temporal structure (power spectrum) of the random series is therefore similar 
as the sample provided.

\code{WG.fwmu.day.precip} has been designed to be used with downscaled results for 
annual wet-day frequency and annual wet-day mean precipitation. It also tries to
simulate the wet-spell duration statistics (number of consecutive wet days) based on
provided sample data (argument x). The process can take annual wet-day mean precipitation 
and the wet-day frequency as input when used to make projections for the future, together 
with a sample station of daily values, to simulate stochastic numbers of consecutive 
wet days, based on its annual mean number of consecutive wet days. It also uses 
the mean annual cycle of wet-day frequency as well as the wet-day mean precipitation 
to guide the seasonal timing of wet days and amounts, and hence tries to mimic rain seasons. 
If not specified, it is taken from the sample data after being phase scrambled/shuffled 
(\code{FTscramble} - a bit like a deck of cards). If not specified, the annual wet-day 
frequency is a phase-scrambled version of annual aggregates from the sample data. The daily 
amount is taken from stochastic values generated with \code{\link{rexp}} scaled 
for the tail according to alpha in (described in DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab2bb2) 
as in \code{\link{day2IDF}}. The number of consecutive wet days is approximated 
by a geometric distribution (\code{\link{rgeom}}), and the annual number of wet days 
is either given as input or estimated from the sample series. 
\code{test.WG.fwmu.day.precip} presents diagnostics of tests of \code{WG.fwmu.day.precip}.
