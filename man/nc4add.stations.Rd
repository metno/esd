\title{Combine or append netCDF files for stations into one. Used with write2ncdf4.station to bypass memory demand/limitations.
The \code{write2ncdf4.station} with the argument append=TRUE also saves data chunk-wise. Another function is 
\code{ncrcat} which reads all data and attributes in listed files and sace them into a new file for all the 
inputs combined.
